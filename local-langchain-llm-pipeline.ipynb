      "Mosaic's financial performance in 2024 showed an increase in net sales and operating earnings compared to the previous year. The company's cash balances and short and long term debt remained relatively stable. The increase in net sales and operating earnings can be attributed to a combination of factors, including higher selling prices, improved product mix, and increased sales volumes. Additionally, Mosaic has been investing in new technologies and processes to improve its efficiency and competitiveness.\n",

The company has been working to reduce its environmental footprint through various initiatives, such as implementing more efficient fertilizer production processes, reducing energy consumption, and investing in renewable energy sources. However, these efforts can be costly and may impact Mosaic's financial performance in the short term. Despite these challenges, Mosaic remains committed to sustainability and is exploring new opportunities for growth while minimizing its environmental impact.\n",
